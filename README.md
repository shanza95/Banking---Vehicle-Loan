# Banking---Vehicle-Loan

### Project Overview:
Banks and financial institutions are incurring significant losses due to vehicle loan defaults — when borrowers fail to repay their loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and an increase in vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.

### Approach:
- Understand why people default: identify key factors and uncover patterns and insights that differentiate defaulters from non-defaulters.
- Train a machine learning model to assist banks in making better loan approval decisions.

### Insights:
