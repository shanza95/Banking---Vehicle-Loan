# Banking---Vehicle-Loan

Problem:
Banks and financial institutions are incurring significant losses due to vehicle loan defaultsâ€”when borrowers fail to repay their loans.

The main goal is to:
- Understand why people default: identify key factors and uncover patterns and insights that differentiate defaulters from non-defaulters.
- Train a machine learning model to assist banks in making better loan approval decisions.
